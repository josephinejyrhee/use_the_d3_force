Using d3-force for force directed layouts

![super cool animated gif](img/d3-force-bubbles.gif)

We'll use the [d3-force]() to create a [Bubble Chart](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/06/us/politics/convention-word-counts.html#Auto) and discuss what goes into making a force layout. We'll explore rendering our chart in both SVG and Canvas, to see the benefits and drawbacks to both.
